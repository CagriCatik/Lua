# Loops

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, enabling repetitive execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met. Lua, a powerful yet lightweight scripting language, offers robust support for loops, including `for`, `while`, and `repeat` loops. Understanding how these loops function in Lua is crucial for developing efficient and effective code. This tutorial will systematically explore the different types of loops in Lua, their syntax, and their applications.

## The `for` Loop

### Syntax and Basic Usage

In Lua, the `for` loop is typically used to iterate over a range of numbers. The syntax is as follows:

```lua
for i = start, stop, step do
    -- Code block to execute
end
```

- **`i`**: The loop control variable.
- **`start`**: The initial value of `i`.
- **`stop`**: The final value of `i`, where the loop terminates.
- **`step`** *(optional)*: The increment or decrement value for each iteration. If omitted, the step defaults to `1`.

### Example

Let's examine a basic example:

```lua
for i = 1, 10, 1 do
    print(i)
end
```

This loop initializes `i` to `1`, increments it by `1` each iteration, and prints the value of `i` until `i` exceeds `10`. The output of this code would be:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Local Scope in Lua

In Lua, loop variables like `i` are local by default. This means that the variable `i` is only accessible within the loop's body. If you try to print `i` outside the loop, you will receive a `nil` value, as demonstrated below:

```lua
for i = 1, 10 do
    print(i)
end
print(i)  -- This will print 'nil'
```

### Adjusting the Step Value

The step value determines how much `i` is incremented (or decremented) on each iteration. For instance, if we modify the step value:

```lua
for i = 1, 10, 2 do
    print(i)
end
```

This loop increments `i` by `2` each time, resulting in the following output:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### Reverse Iteration

To iterate in reverse, you can provide a negative step value:

```lua
for i = 10, 1, -1 do
    print(i)
end
```

This loop counts down from `10` to `1`, producing:

```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

### Using Variables in the `for` Loop

Variables can be utilized for dynamic loop bounds and step values:

```lua
local start_val = 1
local end_val = 10
local step_val = 2

for i = start_val, end_val, step_val do
    print(i)
end
```

This approach allows for more flexible loops, where bounds and step values can be determined at runtime.

### Iterating Over Arrays

Lua also allows iterating over arrays (or tables) using a `for` loop:

```lua
local array = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

for i = 1, #array do
    print(array[i])
end
```

Here, `#array` returns the length of the array, and the loop iterates through each element, printing:

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

## The `while` Loop

### Basic Syntax and Usage

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the condition provided is true. The general form is:

```lua
while condition do
    -- Code block to execute
end
```

### Example

Consider a scenario where we want to decrease a value until it reaches zero:

```lua
local peeps = 10

while peeps > 0 do
    print("People left at the party:", peeps)
    peeps = peeps - 1
end
```

This loop continues to print the number of people left at the party until `peeps` becomes `0`.

### Infinite Loops

A common use of the `while` loop is to create infinite loops, typically controlled by a condition or external event. For example:

```lua
while true do
    print("Infinite loop")
end
```

This loop runs indefinitely unless interrupted by an external action (e.g., a break condition).

## The `repeat ... until` Loop

### Syntax and Functionality

The `repeat ... until` loop is similar to the `while` loop but with one key difference: the condition is evaluated after the loop body is executed, guaranteeing that the loop runs at least once. The syntax is:

```lua
repeat
    -- Code block to execute
until condition
```

### Example

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```lua
local x = 1

repeat
    print("x is:", x)
    x = x + 1
until x > 10
```

This loop increments `x` from `1` to `10`, printing each value. Even if the condition is initially false, the loop executes once before checking.

### Key Difference from `while`

The `repeat ... until` loop is particularly useful when the loop must execute at least once, regardless of the initial condition. Consider the following comparison:

```lua
local x = 11

while x < 10 do
    print("This will not run")
end

repeat
    print("This will run at least once")
until x < 10
```

In the `while` loop, the condition is false at the start, so the loop never executes. However, the `repeat ... until` loop runs once before checking the condition.

## Summary

In Lua, loops are a powerful tool for repetitive tasks. This tutorial has covered:

1. **The `for` loop**: For iterating over a range of numbers with optional steps, and reverse counting.
2. **The `while` loop**: For running code blocks as long as a condition is true.
3. **The `repeat ... until` loop**: Similar to `while`, but guarantees at least one execution.

Understanding and correctly implementing these loops will allow you to create more efficient and dynamic Lua programs. Loops are essential in scenarios where repeated execution is required, such as iterating over collections, handling user inputs, or maintaining game logic.

Each type of loop has its own unique strengths and appropriate use cases, making them indispensable tools in any programmer's toolkit. As you continue developing in Lua, mastering these loop constructs will significantly enhance your coding efficiency and effectiveness.
