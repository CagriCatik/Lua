# Functions

## Introduction

In software development, functions are foundational constructs that allow developers to encapsulate and reuse code, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability. In Lua, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This tutorial aims to elucidate the concept of functions in Lua, providing detailed explanations and examples to illustrate their usage effectively.

## Understanding Functions

### Definition and Basic Usage

A function in Lua is a block of code that can be executed whenever needed. It is a reusable piece of logic that helps avoid repetition and improves the organization of your code.

Consider the following example:

```lua
function display_age(age)
    print("You are " .. age .. " years old.")
    print("You will be " .. (age + 2) .. " years old in two years.")
    print("You were " .. (age - 1) .. " years old last year.")
end
```

Here, the `display_age` function encapsulates three print statements that are logically related. The `age` parameter allows the function to be flexible and adaptable to different inputs.

### Invocation and Benefits

To execute the function, you simply call it with the required argument:

```lua
display_age(5)
```

This call will output:
```
You are 5 years old.
You will be 7 years old in two years.
You were 4 years old last year.
```

By using a function, you avoid the need to repeat the same block of code multiple times. This reduces the risk of errors, especially in larger programs, where manual updates to repetitive code blocks can lead to inconsistencies and bugs.

## Function Parameters and Return Values

### Parameters

Functions can take parameters, allowing them to operate on different inputs. In the previous example, `age` is a parameter that can vary with each function call.

```lua
function display_age(age)
    print("You are " .. age .. " years old.")
end
```

When you call `display_age(22)`, the function uses the value `22` in its operations.

### Default Parameters

Lua allows setting default values for parameters, which are used when no argument is provided during the function call.

```lua
function display_age(age)
    age = age or 5
    print("You are " .. age .. " years old.")
end
```

If you call `display_age()` without any arguments, the function will use the default value of `5`.

### Return Values

Functions can return values, enabling the result of their computations to be used elsewhere in the code.

```lua
function sum(num1, num2)
    return num1 + num2
end

local result = sum(10, 5)
print(result)  -- Outputs: 15
```

The `return` statement exits the function, providing the specified value to the caller. Note that after a `return` statement is executed, no further code in the function is run.

## Scope: Local and Global

### Local Functions and Variables

In Lua, variables and functions can be declared as `local`, restricting their scope to the block of code in which they are defined. This is crucial for avoiding unintended side effects in larger programs.

```lua
local function local_function()
    local x = 10
    print(x)
end
```

Here, `x` is a local variable and cannot be accessed outside of `local_function`.

### Global Scope

Variables or functions that are not declared as `local` are global by default, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

```lua
function global_function()
    y = 20  -- y is global
    print(y)
end
```

It's generally advisable to limit the use of global variables to avoid conflicts and maintain clean, modular code.

## Advanced Function Concepts

### Anonymous Functions

Lua supports anonymous functions, which are functions without a name. These are useful for short-lived, single-use pieces of code, often used as arguments to other functions.

```lua
local add_ten = function(num)
    return num + 10
end

print(add_ten(5))  -- Outputs: 15
```

### Multiple Return Values

A Lua function can return multiple values, which can be captured by separate variables.

```lua
function add_and_subtract(num1, num2)
    return num1 + num2, num1 - num2
end

local sum, difference = add_and_subtract(10, 5)
print(sum, difference)  -- Outputs: 15  5
```

### Recursive Functions

A recursive function is one that calls itself. This is useful for tasks that can be broken down into similar subtasks.

```lua
function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 then
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
end

print(factorial(5))  -- Outputs: 120
```

### Varargs (`...`)

Lua functions can accept a variable number of arguments using `...`. This is useful when the exact number of inputs is not known.

```lua
function sum_all(...)
    local sum = 0
    for _, v in ipairs({...}) do
        sum = sum + v
    end
    return sum
end

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4))  -- Outputs: 10
```

## Conclusion

Functions are powerful tools in Lua, allowing for clean, modular, and maintainable code. Understanding how to define, invoke, and manipulate functions, as well as how to manage their scope and parameters, is essential for any Lua developer. By mastering these concepts, you can write more efficient and robust Lua programs.
