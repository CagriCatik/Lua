# Handling User Input

This tutorial focuses on a fundamental concept in programming—handling user input. By understanding and effectively utilizing user input, you can create interactive and dynamic applications. This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to manage user input in Lua, explores potential pitfalls, and demonstrates how to build a simple mathematical game that incorporates these concepts.

User input is a critical component in many applications. It allows programs to interact with users, making the software more dynamic and responsive to user actions. In Lua, the primary method for capturing user input from the terminal is the `io.read` function. Understanding how to use this function correctly is essential for building interactive applications.

## Basic User Input with `io.read`

The `io.read` function in Lua is used to read input from the standard input (typically the terminal). The function can capture user input as a string, and this input can then be processed or stored in a variable for further use.

Here’s a basic example:

```lua
-- Capture user input
local input = io.read()

-- Print the captured input
print("You entered: " .. input)
```

In this example, the program waits for the user to type something and press Enter. Whatever the user types is then printed back to the terminal.

## Storing and Processing User Input

To store the user input for later use, you assign the result of `io.read()` to a variable. For example:

```lua
-- Prompt the user
print("What is 10 + 5?")

-- Store the user's answer
local answer = io.read()

-- Print the user's answer
print("Your answer is: " .. answer)
```

## Converting Input to Numbers

User input captured via `io.read()` is stored as a string. To perform numerical operations, you must convert this string to a number using the `tonumber` function. This is crucial when dealing with mathematical operations:

```lua
-- Ask the user for a number
print("Enter a number:")

-- Capture and convert input to a number
local number = tonumber(io.read())

-- Perform a calculation
local result = number + 10

-- Display the result
print("Your number plus 10 is: " .. result)
```

If the input cannot be converted to a number, `tonumber` will return `nil`, which should be handled to avoid runtime errors.

## Controlling Output Format

By default, Lua’s `print` function appends a newline after each call. If you need to print something without moving to the next line, use the `io.write` function instead. This function does not add a newline unless explicitly instructed:

```lua
-- Prompt user on the same line
io.write("What is 10 + 5? ")

-- Capture and display user input
local answer = io.read()
print("You answered: " .. answer)
```

This can be useful for creating more sophisticated user interfaces in the terminal, where the input prompt and the user’s response appear on the same line.

## Building a Simple Math Game

Let’s apply these concepts to create a simple math game where the user is asked to solve a basic addition problem. The game will check the user's answer and provide feedback.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define Variables:**

   Define the numbers involved in the math problem:

   ```lua
   local num1 = 10
   local num2 = 5
   ```

2. **Calculate the Correct Answer:**

   Compute the correct answer:

   ```lua
   local correctAnswer = num1 + num2
   ```

3. **Prompt the User:**

   Prompt the user for their answer:

   ```lua
   io.write("What is " .. num1 .. " + " .. num2 .. "? ")
   local userAnswer = tonumber(io.read())
   ```

4. **Validate the User’s Answer:**

   Compare the user's answer with the correct answer and provide feedback:

   ```lua
   if userAnswer == correctAnswer then
       print("You are correct!")
   else
       print("Your answer is incorrect. The correct answer is " .. correctAnswer .. ".")
   end
   ```

5. **Full Code:**

   Here is the complete code for the game:

   ```lua
   local num1 = 10
   local num2 = 5
   local correctAnswer = num1 + num2

   io.write("What is " .. num1 .. " + " .. num2 .. "? ")
   local userAnswer = tonumber(io.read())

   if userAnswer == correctAnswer then
       print("You are correct!")
   else
       print("Your answer is incorrect. The correct answer is " .. correctAnswer .. ".")
   end
   ```

   This program asks the user to solve a simple math problem. The user's input is captured and compared to the correct answer, and the program then provides appropriate feedback.

## Handling Edge Cases

Consider adding checks for invalid input, such as when the user enters a non-numeric value. This can prevent errors and make the program more robust:

```lua
local userAnswer = tonumber(io.read())

if userAnswer == nil then
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
else
    if userAnswer == correctAnswer then
        print("You are correct!")
    else
        print("Your answer is incorrect. The correct answer is " .. correctAnswer .. ".")
    end
end
```

This enhancement ensures that the program gracefully handles unexpected inputs and guides the user toward providing valid input.

## Conclusion

Understanding and effectively using user input is essential for creating interactive programs. Lua’s `io.read` function is a powerful tool for capturing user input, and when combined with basic control structures, it allows developers to build interactive and engaging applications. The mathematical game example illustrates how these concepts can be applied in a real-world scenario, providing a foundation for more complex projects.
