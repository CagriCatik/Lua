# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to model real-world entities as objects within code. Each object encapsulates both data and the behaviors that operate on that data. This approach contrasts with procedural programming, where the focus is on functions and procedures to perform operations. While Lua is not inherently an object-oriented language, OOP can be simulated through various techniques.

## Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming

Before diving into OOP, it's crucial to understand the difference between procedural programming and object-oriented programming:

- **Procedural Programming**: In this paradigm, the focus is on writing procedures or functions that operate on data. Code is organized as a series of functions, each performing specific tasks. This is the approach we've used in earlier lessons, where we write functions that manipulate data and call other functions as needed.

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: OOP organizes code into objects, each representing a concept or entity. An object has properties (data) and methods (functions) that define its behavior. For example, in a game, you might have objects representing a player, enemies, items, etc. Each of these objects would have their own properties (e.g., health, position) and methods (e.g., move, attack).

## Simulating Object-Oriented Programming in Lua

Lua, by default, does not support OOP natively like languages such as Python, C++, or Java. However, Lua is flexible enough that we can simulate OOP using tables and functions. In Lua, tables are the primary data structure, and they can be used to represent objects.

## Creating Objects with Tables

A table in Lua can store different types of data, including strings, numbers, and even other tables or functions. To create an object, we define a table and assign properties to it. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```lua
local pet = {
    name = "Ginger",
    status = "hungry",
}

print(pet.name)  -- Outputs: Ginger
```

In the above example, `pet` is a table that represents an object with properties `name` and `status`. We can access these properties using the dot notation.

## Simulating Methods

To simulate methods (functions that operate on the object), we define functions within the table:

```lua
function pet:feed()
    self.status = "full"
end
```

Here, `feed` is a method that changes the `status` of the pet. The `self` keyword refers to the object that calls the method.

## Using a Constructor Function

In OOP, objects are typically created using a constructor function. In Lua, we can simulate this by writing a function that returns a table:

```lua
function createPet(name)
    local pet = {
        name = name or "Unnamed",
        status = "hungry",
    }
    
    function pet:feed()
        self.status = "full"
    end

    return pet
end

local myPet = createPet("Kitty")
print(myPet.name)  -- Outputs: Kitty
myPet:feed()
print(myPet.status)  -- Outputs: full
```

The `createPet` function acts as a constructor, creating and returning a new `pet` object.

## Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques in Lua

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a key feature of OOP, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. In Lua, we can simulate inheritance by creating a new table and setting its metatable to another table (the base class).

```lua
function createDog(name, breed)
    local dog = createPet(name)
    dog.breed = breed

    function dog:bark()
        print("Woof! Woof!")
    end

    return dog
end

local myDog = createDog("Lassie", "Collie")
myDog:bark()  -- Outputs: Woof! Woof!
```

In this example, `createDog` function creates a `dog` object that inherits from `pet` and adds additional properties and methods.

## Overriding Methods

In OOP, subclass methods can override methods in the base class. We can achieve this in Lua by defining a method with the same name in the subclass:

```lua
function createDog(name, breed)
    local dog = createPet(name)
    dog.breed = breed

    function dog:feed()
        self.status = "full"
        self.loyalty = (self.loyalty or 0) + 5
    end

    function dog:bark()
        print("Woof! Woof!")
    end

    return dog
end

local myDog = createDog("Lassie", "Collie")
myDog:feed()
print(myDog.status)  -- Outputs: full
```

In this case, the `feed` method in `dog` overrides the `feed` method in `pet`, adding new behavior (increasing loyalty).

## Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to model complex systems more naturally by representing entities as objects with properties and behaviors. Even though Lua does not natively support OOP, its flexibility with tables and functions allows us to simulate OOP effectively. 

Understanding these concepts, even in a language like Lua, is critical for developing more maintainable and scalable software. By applying OOP principles, you can create robust applications that are easier to extend and manage.
