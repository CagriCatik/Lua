# `if` Statements

In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of `if` statements in Lua. This will provide you with the necessary tools to implement conditional logic in your code, a crucial aspect of any programming language. Mastering `if` statements allows you to control the flow of your program by executing specific blocks of code based on conditions.

## Booleans in Lua

Before diving into `if` statements, it's essential to understand the Boolean data type in Lua. In Lua, Booleans can be either `true` or `false`. Additionally, Lua treats `nil` (the absence of a value) as `false` in conditional expressions. However, it's crucial to note that `nil` and `false` are not the same; both simply evaluate to `false` in a Boolean context.

```lua
if true then
    print("The statement was true")
end
```

The code above will print "The statement was true" because the condition `true` evaluates as true. If you change the condition to `false`:

```lua
if false then
    print("This will not print")
end
```

This code will not print anything because the condition `false` does not satisfy the `if` statement.

## Truthy and Falsy Values in Lua

In Lua, only `false` and `nil` are considered falsy, meaning they evaluate as `false` in a Boolean context. Any other value, including numbers and strings, is considered truthy and evaluates as `true`.

```lua
if 2 then
    print("This will always execute because 2 is truthy")
end
```

The condition in this example evaluates as `true`, causing the code inside the `if` block to execute.

## Comparison Operators

To make `if` statements more useful, Lua provides several comparison operators. These include:

- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `~=`: Not equal to (Note: In Lua, `~=` is used for inequality, unlike many other languages where `!=` is used)
- `==`: Equal to

### Example: Using Comparison Operators

```lua
local age = 15

if age > 17 then
    print("You may enter")
end
```

In this example, the code inside the `if` block will not execute because `age` is less than 17. To include the possibility where `age` is exactly 17, you could modify the condition:

```lua
if age >= 17 then
    print("You may enter")
end
```

This modification allows the block to execute if `age` is either 17 or greater.

### Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`

Logical operators are used to combine or modify Boolean expressions. Lua provides three logical operators:

- `and`: Both conditions must be true.
- `or`: At least one condition must be true.
- `not`: Inverts the Boolean value.

#### Example: Combining Conditions with `and`

```lua
if age >= 17 and age < 60 then
    print("You may enter")
end
```

Here, the code will execute only if both conditions are met: `age` must be at least 17 but less than 60.

#### Example: Combining Conditions with `or`

```lua
if age >= 17 or age < 10 then
    print("You may enter")
end
```

This code will execute if either condition is true.

#### Example: Using the `not` Operator

```lua
if not (age < 18) then
    print("You may enter")
end
```

In this case, the `not` operator inverts the condition. If `age` is not less than 18, the code inside the `if` block will execute.

## `if-else` and `if-elseif-else` Statements

To provide alternative outcomes when a condition is not met, Lua allows the use of `else` and `elseif` statements.

### Example: Using `if-else`

```lua
if age > 20 then
    print("You are old")
else
    print("You are young")
end
```

In this example, if the `age` is not greater than 20, the code under `else` will execute.

### Example: Using `if-elseif-else`

```lua
if age > 20 then
    print("You are old")
elseif age > 10 then
    print("You are not old or young")
else
    print("You are young")
end
```

This structure allows for multiple conditional checks, where only the first matching condition's block will execute.

### Example: Nesting `if` Statements

You can also nest `if` statements to create more complex logical structures.

```lua
if type(age) == "number" then
    if age > 17 then
        print("You may enter")
    end
end
```

## The Ternary Operator in Lua

Lua does not natively support a traditional ternary operator like some other languages. However, a similar effect can be achieved using logical operators.

### Example: Simulating a Ternary Operator

```lua
local old = age > 30 and true or false
```

In this example, `old` will be `true` if `age` is greater than 30, and `false` otherwise. The expression is evaluated as follows: if the first condition (`age > 30`) is true, the `and` operator returns `true`. If not, the `or` operator returns `false`.

### Important Notes on Lua's Ternary-like Behavior

It's important to note that this approach is not a direct replacement for ternary operators in languages like C or Python. The behavior relies on Lua's evaluation of the `and` and `or` operators and may lead to unexpected results if not carefully used.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has covered the basic and advanced usage of `if` statements in Lua, including Boolean logic, comparison and logical operators, and the Lua equivalent of a ternary operator. By mastering these concepts, you can control the flow of your Lua programs, enabling them to perform complex decision-making processes. Proper use of `if` statements is critical in writing robust and maintainable code.

To further solidify your understanding, consider experimenting with different conditional logic scenarios in Lua, and observe how the behavior of `if` statements changes based on various conditions.

This knowledge is foundational to your development as a Lua programmer and will serve you well in any projects that require conditional logic.
